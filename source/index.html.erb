      <h3>Organization change due to pandemic situation</h3>
      <p>
        Due to the pandemic situation worldwide, the Program Committee and the
        organizers of the TTC decided that the TTC 2020 will be held as an
        online event, decoupled from STAF unlike earlier announcements. In
        particular, we plan the folowing changes compared to previous editions:

        <ul>
          <li>The event will take place as a <strong>free online event</strong>. We are evaluating technical options to host an online event.</li>
          <li>The plan for TTC is to have a <strong>synchronized virtual event</strong> where
            solution authors do present their solutions and answer questions
            from opponent solutions afterwards. However, we also plan to record
            the event such that the presentations can be viewed later on (provided we get the presenters consent).</li>
          <li>The fact that we are decoupled from the STAF schedule means that
          we can be more flexible in terms of timelines. We have therefore <strong>extended the solution submission deadline</strong> to 15th of June.</li>
          <li>The TTC 2020 will not offer a live contest.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
