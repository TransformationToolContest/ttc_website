      <h3>Call for Solutions</h3>

      <p>
        The 2020 Transformation Tool Contest (TTC) seeks your own
        spins of two challenging model transformation problems. The
        deadline for solution descriptions is <strong>15th June 2020</strong>,
        immediately followed by a round of open peer reviewing. As in
        previous editions, solution descriptions will be published in
        a post-proceedings volume, and potentially lead to continued
        collaboration for producing a per-case journal article.
      </p>

      <h4>About TTC</h4>

      <p>The aim of this event is to compare the expressiveness, the usability
and the performance of graph,  model and program transformation tools along
a number of selected case studies. A deeper understanding of the relative
merits of different tool features will help to further improve transformation tools
and to indicate open problems.</p>

<p>This contest is the thirteenth of its kind (after an AGTiVE 2007 session,
as GraBaTs 2008 and 2009 contests, and the TTC 2010, 2011, 2013--2019 contests).
For the seventh time, the contest is co-located with several leading
software engineering conferences as part of the <a href="https://staf2020.hvl.no/">Software
Technologies: Applications and Foundations</a> (STAF) federation. Teams from the major international
research groups in the development and use of transformation tools are
expected to participate in the TTC again.</p>

  <h4>Participating in the Contest</h4>

  <p>The following case studies have been selected:</p>

  <ul>
      <li><a href="2020_ocl2sql.pdf" target="_blank">The TTC 2020 OCL2PSQL Case</a> (<a href="https://github.com/bluezio/ttc2020-ocl2sql">Resources</a>) - <strong>postponed to TTC 2021</strong>.</li>
      <li><a href="2020_roundtrip.pdf" target="_blank">Round-Trip Migration of Object-Oriented Data Model Instances</a> (<a href="https://github.com/lbeurerkellner/ttc2020">Resources</a>)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The case description, supporting resources, and discussion between solution developers are hosted at the source code repositories linked to above.</p>

  <p>If you would like to participate in the contest, you are now
asked to take your favourite transformation tool and submit your
solutions. A submission should consist of a paper and the actual
solution (i.e., programs, models, etc.). The paper should include a description of the chosen case study variant (if any) and a presentation of the chosen solution, including a discussion of design decisions. Examples can be explored at the <a href="http://www.transformation-tool-contest.eu/2018/">TTC 2018 website</a>.</p>

<p>Solutions should be submitted via <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ttc20">Easychair</a> by <strong>15th June 2020</strong>. Before the same deadline, each case study solution (tool,
    project files, documentation) should be made available for review and demonstration via a public version control repository (e.g. on Github or Bitbucket). <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">Docker Hub</a> images would be highly appreciated as well.</p>

<p>Immediately after the submission deadline, please note solution developers will be asked to participate in a round of <em>open review</em> of other solutions. Therefore, we ask that all solution developers are available in the period <strong>16th June to 3rd July 2020</strong> to participate in these discussions.</p>

<p>Please note that solutions that are ultimately published in the post-proceedings will not exceed 5 pages and will be formatted using the <a href=http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/samplestyles/?"">CEUR-WS style</a>. There are no such page limit or formatting restrictions on the initial descriptions of a solution (i.e., the solutions submitted on the 1st of June).</p>

<p>Besides the presentations of the submitted solutions, we will have an online event where solution authors will be asked to present their solutions in front of a bigger audience and answer any questions afterwards. The date of this event will be defined together with solution authors.</p>

  <h4>Publication Procedure</h4>
  <p>For TTC 2020 there will be several publication opportunities:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The informal pre-proceedings will appear on the TTC website. They
    contain the descriptions of the accepted cases and all the solution
    papers.</li>
      <li>After the contest there will be more formal contest proceedings.
    Solution submitters have to consider and address the opponents' statements.
    The resulting solution papers will be reviewed by the TTC program
    committee. A selection of revised solution papers together with the
    case descriptions will be published in the contest proceedings
    which are currently planned to appear in WS-CEUR.</li>
      <li>Past editions of TTC have often resulted in one journal publication per case. Those articles have introduced the case and compare the solutions from a high-level perspective. Also the results of the evaluation sheets filled in during the contest were considered. These articles were compiled and edited by the case submitters together with the contest organizers.</li>
