8th Transformation Tool Contest 2015.

23rd July 2015
York, United Kingdom.

Part of STAF 2015 (http://www.disim.univaq.it/staf2015/)

** Call for Solutions **

The 2015 Transformation Tool Contest (TTC) seeks your solutions to three challenging transformation problems, involving incremental model validation, refactoring Java programs, and model execution.

Select your favourite model, program or graph transformation tool and join the contest! The deadline for solution descriptions is 29 April 2015. More information, including links to the problem descriptions, below and on our website at: http://www.transformation-tool-contest.eu/cfs.html


1. About TTC

The aim of this event is to compare the expressiveness, the usability and the performance of graph,  model and program transformation tools along a number of selected case studies. A deeper understanding of the relative merits of different tool features will help to further improve transformation tools and to indicate open problems.

This contest is the eighth of its kind (after an AGTiVE 2007 session, as GraBaTs 2008 and 2009 contests, and the TTC 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2014 contests). For the third time, the contest is co-located with several leading software engineering conferences as part of the Software Technologies: Applications and Foundations (STAF) federation (http://www.disim.univaq.it/staf2015/). Teams from the major international research groups in the development and use of transformation tools are expected to participate in the TTC again.


2. Participating in the Contest

The following two challenging case studies have been selected:

* The Train Benchmark for Incremental Validation - by Gabor Szarnyas, Oszkar Semerath, Istvan Rath, and Daniel Varro
(https://github.com/FTSRG/trainbenchmark-ttc)

* The Model Execution Case - by Tanja Mayerhofer and Manuel Wimmer
(https://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/moliz/source/browse/?repo=ttc2015)

* The Java Refactoring Case - by Geza Kulcsar, Sven Peldszus and Malte Lochau
(TBA)

The case description, supporting resources, and discussion between solution developers are hosted at the repositories linked to above. **Please note** that these repositories are in draft form until 2nd April: you can expect to see some small changes to the cases until then.

If you would like to participate in the contest, you are now asked to choose one or more case studies, take your favourite transformation tool and submit your solutions. A submission should consist of a paper and the actual solution (i.e., programs, models, etc.). The paper should include a description of the chosen case study variant (if any) and a presentation of the chosen solution, including a discussion of design decisions. Examples can be explored at the TTC 2014 website (http://www.transformation-tool-contest.eu/2014/).

Solutions should be submitted via Easychair by 29 April 2015. Before the same deadline, each case study solution (tool, project files, documentation) should be made available for review and demonstration via SHARE. Wherever possible, solution source code should be made available in a public repository on a popular source forge (e.g. Github or Bitbucket). For submissions via Easychair, sign-up and instructions to SHARE, please visit:

* Easychair submission page: http://www.easychair.org/conferences?conf=ttc2015
* SHARE sign-up: http://is.tm.tue.nl/staff/pvgorp/share/?page=Signup&bundlename=TTC15
* SHARE wiki: https://fmt.ewi.utwente.nl/redmine/projects/grabats/wiki

Immediately after the submission deadline, please note solution developers will be asked to participate in a round of open review of other solutions. Therefore, we ask that all solution developers are available in the period 29 Apr 2015 to 27 May 2015 to participate in these discussions.

Please note that solutions that are ultimately published in the post-proceedings will not exceed 5 pages and will be formatted using the EPTCS style (http://info.eptcs.org). There are no such page limit or formatting restrictions on the initial descriptions of a solution (i.e., the solutions submitted on 29th April).

Besides the presentations of the submitted solutions, the contest held on the 23 Jul 2015 in l'Aquila (Italy) will comprise a live contest: an additional transformation case that will not be announced until a few days before the contest. There will be dedicated hackspace during the week of STAF for solution developers wishing to work on the live contest.


3. Publication Procedure

For TTC 2015 there will be several publication opportunities:

* The informal pre-proceedings will appear on the TTC website. They contain the descriptions of the accepted cases and all the solution papers.

* After the contest there will be more formal contest proceedings. Solution submitters have to consider and address the opponents' statements. The resulting solution papers will be reviewed by the TTC program committee. A selection of revised solution papers together with the case descriptions will be published in the contest proceedings which are currently planned to appear in WS-CEUR.

* Past editions of TTC have often resulted in one journal publication per case. Those articles have introduced the case and compare the solutions from a high-level perspective. Also the results of the evaluation sheets filled in during the contest were considered. These articles were compiled and edited by the case submitters together with the contest organizers. We anticipate interest in similar efforts following the 2015 edition of the contest
