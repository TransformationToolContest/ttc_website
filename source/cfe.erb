        The 2025 Transformation Tool Contest (TTC) seeks your own
        spins of four interesting model transformation problems. The
        deadline for solution descriptions is <strong><%= data.settings.submission %></strong>,
        immediately followed by a round of open peer reviewing. As in
        previous editions, solution descriptions will be published in
        a post-proceedings volume, and lead to continued
        collaboration for producing a per-case journal article.
      </p>

      <h4>About TTC</h4>

      <p>The aim of this event is to compare the expressiveness, the usability
        and the performance of graph,  model and program transformation tools along
        a number of selected case studies. A deeper understanding of the relative
        merits of different tool features will help to further improve transformation tools
      and to indicate open problems.</p>

      <p>This contest is the fifteenth of its kind (after an AGTiVE 2007 session,
        as GraBaTs 2008 and 2009 contests, and the TTC 2010, 2011, 2013--2021 contests).
        For the eighth time, the contest is co-located with several leading
        software engineering conferences as part of the
        <a href="<%= data.settings.stafLink %>">Software Technologies: Applications and Foundations</a>
        (STAF) federation. Teams from the major international research groups
        in the development and use of transformation tools are expected to
      participate in the TTC again.</p>

      <h4>Solutions to older cases</h4>

      <p>Transformation tools have evolved and continue to evolve, but use cases of the past are still relevant. To foster a culture of community-accepted benchmarks,
         the TTC now also accepts submissions that solve older cases. References to prior cases can be found <a href="cases.html">here</a>. 
         Please note that for solutions to these prior cases, we expect solution authors to compare their solutions with other existing solutions.</p>

      <p>Submissions of solutions to past cases will undergo the same peer-review process as solutions to the selected case from the past year. We will try to have the solution submission
         reviewed by of the original case authors or original solution authors. </p>
 
         <p>Solutions should be submitted via <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ttc2025">Easychair</a> by <strong>TBA</strong>. Before the same deadline, each case study solution (tool,
           project files, documentation) should be made available for review and demonstration via a public version control repository (e.g. on Github or Bitbucket). <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">Docker Hub</a> images would be highly appreciated as well.</p>
 
             <h4>Publication Procedure</h4>
 
             <p>For TTC 2025 there will be several publication opportunities:</p>
 
             <ul>
               <li>There will be formal contest proceedings.
                 Solution submitters have to consider and address the opponents' statements.
                 The resulting solution papers will be reviewed by the TTC program
                 committee. A selection of revised solution papers together with the
               case descriptions will be published in the contest proceedings.</li>
               <li>New solutions or significant improvements to existing solutions may also lead to new joint (journal) papers for the case,
         especially if such a paper was not successful due to an unsufficient amount of solutions in the past. 
               </li>
