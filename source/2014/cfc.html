      <h3>Call for Cases</h3>
      <p>In order to facilitate the 
        comparison of transformation tools, we are soliciting potential 
        case studies. If you have a suitable case study, please 
        describe it shortly but as detailed as needed and submit it to 
        the online submission system. Cases that have already been 
        solved using a particular tool (or general purpose programming 
        language) are also very welcome. Please include a reference 
        solution for such cases to support the evaluation of the 
        correctness of submitted solutions.</p>

      <p>Our program committee will select a small, but representative 
        set of case studies to be used for the contest. Case 
        descriptions should answer the following questions:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>What is the context of the case? 
          (provide a short description and references)</li>
          
        <ul>
          <li>What is the subject to be modeled?
          (what are the input and output modeling languages?)</li>

          <li>What is the purpose of the models?
          (what are they typically used for from a larger 
          perspective than the proposed case study?)</li>
        </ul>

        <li>What are variation points in the case?
          (divide up your case in core characteristics 
          and extensions)</li>

        <li>What are the criteria for evaluating the submitted solutions 
          to the case?</li>
          
        <ul>
          <li>Correctness test: which are the reference input/ouput 
            documents (models/graphs) and how should they be used? 
            Ideally, a case description includes a testsuite, as well 
            as a test driver (The test driver can be an online web service, 
            or a local script that can be deployed in SHARE 
            (see <a href="http://is.tm.tue.nl/staff/pvgorp/share">http://is.tm.tue.nl/staff/pvgorp/share</a>)</li>

          <li>Which transformation tool-related features are important 
            and how can they be classified?
            (e.g., formal analysis of the transformation program, rule 
            debugging support, ...) 

          <li>What transformation language-related challenges are 
            important and how can they be classified?
            (e.g., declarative bidirectionality, declarative change 
            propagation, declarative subgraph copying, cyclic graph 
            support, typing issues, ...) 

          <li>How to measure the quality of submitted solutions, at the 
            design level?
            (e.g., measure the number of rules, the conciseness of 
            rules, ...)
        </ul>

        <li>How can the solutions be evaluated (ranked) systematically 
          using information technology?
          Please provide one of the following:
        
        <ul>
          <li>a simple spreadsheet (an evaluation form that can be 
            aggregated easily (See for example <a href="http://goo.gl/QwxTAs">http://goo.gl/QwxTAs</a>), 

          <li>a so-called "classification scheme" in ResearchR 
            (See <a href="http://goo.gl/QA7npw">http://goo.gl/QA7npw</a>)
            (or a similar web 2.0 platform.) 
        </ul>
      </ul>

      <p>Please submit at <a href="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ttc2014">
        http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ttc2014</a>.
      Your submission should include (i) a case description (in PDF 
      format) answering the above questions and (ii) a ZIP archive 
      that contains all test artifacts as well as the evaluation / 
      ranking instrument.</p>
      
      <p>The deadline for cases is <strong>26 Feb 2014</strong>.</p>
      
      <h4>Subsequent Phases</h4>
      <p>Following the selection of a subset of the submitted cases by our
        programme committee, the following phases will be conducted.</p>

      <p><strong>Phase 2</strong>: Case solution submission. All those who like to 
      participate in the contest will be asked to choose one or more 
      case studies, take their favorite transformation tool and 
      submit their solutions. A separate call for solutions will be 
      distributed, after the cases have been selected.</p>

      <p><strong>Phase 3</strong>: Open peer review. The solution reviewing before the 
      workshop will be done by other solution submitters. All 
      solution submitters have to review three other solutions to the 
      case that they have addressed. These reviews will not be 
      anonymous, since these reviewers ideally will also be the 
      opponents at the workshop. The purpose of the peer reviewing is 
      that the participants get as much insight into the competitor's 
      solutions as possible and also to raise potential problems. 
      Case submitters should be available at this stage to resolve 
      conflicting interpretations (if any) about the case 
      description.</p>

      <p><strong>Phase 4</strong>: Workshop and live contest. Besides the presentations of 
      the submitted solutions, the workshop will comprise a live 
      contest. For more details (such as example cases and solutions 
      from previous editions), please consult the TTC website:
